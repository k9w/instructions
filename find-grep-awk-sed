find file1 and file2

cd /home/kevin/learn/www.shellscript.sh
mkdir sdir
cd sdir
touch file1 file2
cd ../..
pwd
/home/kevin/learn

find . -name file*
./www.shellscript.sh/sdir/file1
./www.shellscript.sh/sdir/file2


delete sdir and file1 and file2 in that directory

find . -name sdir -delete

This did not work as intended. Instead, find and delete the files
first; then find and delete the directory.

find ~/bin/learn/www.shellscript.sh/sdir -name file* -delete
find ./www.shellscript.sh -name sdir -delete


find all regular files and grep for dnssec; print each file name
matched and the line of text matched.

find /usr/src/usr.sbin -type f -exec grep -H 'dnssec' {} \;
