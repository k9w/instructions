Installed kde-plasma-extras and followed package readme at
`/usr/share/docs/pkg-readmes/kde-plasma`.

Issues:

Dark mode from system settings does not work correctly. It usually does
not apply to the body of the system settings window. When it does apply,
the text remains the original dark color and is unreadable on the dark
background. 

Konsole terminal cannot be fully full-screened. The scroll bar cannot be
removed. The top menu bar cannot be fully hidden in full screen mode.
Adding or removing menu bar components does not usually apply. The left
side items on the top menu bar cannot be added back once removed.

Alt-tab to switch apps does not work at all.

When docked to multiple monitors, the super key to open the applications
menu does not work at all.

System Settings > Display Configuration - Does not correctly identify or
adjust placement, identification, or display of multiple monitors. The
external screens sometimes go black and only show the mouse if moved
across them. One of the monitors did not even show the mouse moving
across. ArandR still worked to arrange the monitors.

When connected to multiple monitors, the Task Manager (bottom bar) shows
bigger than when only the laptop screen is connected. And the pinned app
icons are smashed together and overlap. And when opening the application
menu with the mouse, the menu itself opens on a different monitor than
the bottom bar and is also too big for the screen.
