Most of this works in the browser console. So far, none of it works in NodeJS.

  const age = prompt('How old are you?');
  const name = prompt('What is your name?');

// Example of globally-scoped variable.

let globalString = "This is a global variable.";

function sampleFunction() {
  alert(globalString + ' - called in function');
  globalString = 'This is a global variable update.';
  alert(globalString + ' - called in function after rename');
}
      
alert(globalString + ' - called before function');
sampleFunction();
alert(globalString + ' - called after function');


// Example of locally-scoped variable.

function sampleFunction() {
  let localString = 'This is a local variable.';
  alert(localString + ' - before rename, in function');
  localString = 'This is a local variable update.';
  alert(localString + ' - after rename, in function');
}

sampleFunction();
alert(localString + ' - outside function, after its called.');



// The code below works but is wrong, because not using 'const' or 'let'
// assumes usage of 'var' and makes the variable global, which is bad.

function sampleFunction() {
  localString = 'This is a local variable.';
  alert(localString + ' - before rename, in the function');
  localString = 'This is a local variable update.';
  alert(localString + ' - after rename, in the function');
}

sampleFunction();
alert(localString + ' - outside the function, after its called.');
