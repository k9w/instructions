https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BvFf1uuaK4

I've done some work taking a look over my financials. I would be much
more comfortable taking the position if we can get to 115. I'm trying
to take money off the table, so that we can focus on the important
work at <company-name>.

What are your salary expectations?

0 or a million dollars

What is the range for the position?

What is important to me is that I make sure <company-name> is a good
fit for me. I want to make sure things work out, that this is going to
be successfull for both of us. Let's go through the process. I want to
make sure I'm a good fit for the the team, the team is a good fit for
me. When we get to that point, we can discuss it.

Many companies will walk away at this point. But for those that don't,
they'll be somewhat willing to work with me because they've invested
HR and hiring manager time in me with interviews by the time they get
to the offer.

I just want to be sure that I am comfortable enough financially and
take money off the table so that I can focus on the important work of
<blank> at <company-name>. This number would make me
comfortable. Could you do that?

If they meet me half way, I say I would sign right now if we can get
to 115.

I think that 115 is really about what I can do financially. I need to
make sure I'm comfortable enough and not distracted, that I can focus
on the work.

I understand the company has budget. Let's take the stock options down
and put that into the base salary instead.

Accept their third offer.
