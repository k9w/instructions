Today Discord failed to launch because an update is available. I had
installed it from DNF in RPM Fusion. That older version is still listed
there. So today I added the Flathub repo for Flatpak. Flatpak came
pre-installed on Fedora.

I searched for and installed the Flatpak of Discord in Plasma Discover.
It launched successfully. So I removed the DNF version of Discord and rebooted.

I had also previously installed Postman from their site. Today I
installed its Flatpak, tested it successfully, and removed the website
install.
