# _Instructions for my future self, and maybe for you too_

## Backstory

I've used Linux, OpenBSD, and open source tools for several years and
documented how I did many things along the way. On September 10 2021, I
started tracking my documentation in Git. On September 19 2022, I cloned
this repo from a cloud VM where I had been self-hosting it over to Github
in the hope that you might benefit from it too.

Starting in April 2022, I have also written Linux documentation as part
of my job at C-Tran, including a detailed guide on tmux with ample
screenshots. I hope to secure my employer's permission to post it here
too.

## Current state and level of polish

For much of this repo's commit history, I quickly posted content as I
went and intended it for my personal use. Therefore, some of it is in a
very rough, unpolished state. I plan to clean it up as I have time.

## Tools covered

Many of these tools are:

* Version control: git, svn, cvs
* Webservers: Apache, Nginx, OpenBSD's httpd
* Shell scripting, backups, environment setups (epicodus)
* Sound and wifi setup specific to OpenBSD
* Other topics not listed here
