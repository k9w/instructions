CVS uses keyword substitution. I'm waiting on adding it here until I
learn if Subversion has a different strategy.

https://subversion.apache.org/quick-start
Setting up a local repository 

~/.subversion already existed and has client configuration files. Make
a separate directory for a local repository.

mkdir ~/.svnrepos

### I stopped here. I have renamed cvs paths to not conflict with SVN
paths. Do I want to rename .svnprepos to k9w-svn ? ###

svnadmin create ~/.svnrepos/learn-svn

svn mkdir -m "Create directory structure." \
  file://$HOME/.svnrepos/MyRepo/trunk \
  file://$HOME/.svnrepos/MyRepo/branches \
  file://$HOME/.svnrepos/MyRepo/tags

Create a parent directory .svnrepos where you will place your SVN repositories:
mkdir -p ~/.svnrepos

Create a new repository MyRepo under .svnrepos:
svnadmin create ~/.svnrepos/learn-svn

Create a recommended project layout in the new repository:
svn mkdir -m "Create directory structure." \
	file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/trunk \
	file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/branches \
	file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/tags

Change directory to ~/bin/learn-svn where your unversioned project is
located:

cd $HOME/bin/learn-svn

Convert the current directory into a working copy of the trunk/ in the
repository:
svn checkout file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/trunk ./

Schedule your project's files to be added to the repository:
svn add --force ./

Commit the project's files:
svn commit -m "Initial import."

Update your working copy:
svn update

RCS and CVS use per-file version numbers. SVN uses repository-wide
version numbers.

According to svnbook.red-bean.com, CVS store binary files such as pdf
and docx as whole revisions of binary files. SVN can examine binary
files better and can store revisions more space-efficiently on the
server as binary diffs, whereas CVS needs to store an entire copy of
each revision of a binary file in its repository.

Therefore SVN is better for pdf, docx, sound, pictures, videos, compiled
code, and any binary data who's versions should be tracked.

Here I created learn-svn project (like a CVS module) in my k9w-svn
repository. No specials repo files are in the root of k9w-svn.
svnadmin create ~/k9w-svn/learn-svn

Then I descended into learn-svn and created the recommended
subdirectories 'trunk', 'branches', and 'tags'.
cd ~/k9w-svn/learn-svn
svn mkdir -m "Make trunk directory" file:///home/kevin/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk
Committing transaction...
Committed revision 1.
svn mkdir -m "Make branches and tags directories" \
	file://$HOME/k9w-svn/learn-svn/branches \
	file://$HOME/k9w-svn/learn-svn/tags
Committing transaction...
Committed revision 2.
