Search all files recursively in /usr/src for 'Dragonfly' with exact
capitalization (-i to search case-insensitive):

grep -R Dragonfly /usr/src


Search 'myfile' for all occurrences of .Pp at the start of a line.

grep '^\.Pp' myfile

Single quotes ' are needed to tell the shell to not interpret characters
that are special to it, but to instead pass them through to grep.
The carat ^ matches the regular expression only at the start of a line.
Backslash \ causes . to be interpreted literally by grep, instead of as
a single character . in a regular expression.

Similar to above, but $ means to only match .Pp if it appears at the end 
of a line in myfile.

grep '\.Pp$' myfile

Search myfile for any word that has the letter n in it.

grep .n myfile

Search myfile for all lines not containing foo or bar.

grep -v -e 'foo -e 'bar' myfile

Search myfile for either 19, 20, or 25. This form below is an extended 
regular expression. -n means to print the line number of each match in
myfile.

grep -n -E 19|20|25 myfile

Search grep-xargs for any line starting with l or o.
egrep '^(l|o)' grep-xargs
Currently, this returns only one result which is:
'of a line in myfile.'

Leaving out the ( ) returns far more results (not shown here). Need to
investigate this further as I learn regular expressions.
egrep '^l|o' grep-xargs

Search grep-xargs for any line ending in any letter from l to u
inclusive.
egrep '[l-u]$' grep-xargs
This returns about 8 resultant lines, currently. This is still
case-sensitive.

For the same search for lower AND upper case:
egrep '[l-u]|[L-U]$' grep-xargs


For the same search for lower OR upper case:
egrep '([l-u]|[L-U])$' grep-xargs
egrep -i '[l-u]$' grep-xargs
The search returns fewerer results than above because grep stops once it
has found the lowercase and does not even try for the upercase.

Search myfile for one or more patterns from file instead of specifying a
pattern on the grep command line.

grep -file myfile

Use fgrep to search ~/bin/learn-cvs/* for the literal string '$Id:'
fgrep $Id: ~/bin/learn-cvs/*

However, it also displays several lines after the match in each file
matched. I need to figure out why.

If I search svn_notes for 'rename'
grep rename svn_notes
It will return results for rename and renamed.

To only match rename if it is a whole word and does not have 'd' at the
end:
grep -w rename svn_notes

Here is that same search, with the results, along with their current
line numbers with -n:
grep -wn rename svn_notes
17:paths. Do I want to rename .svnprepos to k9w-svn ? ###
125:To properly track file rename, move, copy, or delete, regular shell

Here it is again, with -C for 2 lines (by default) of surrounding
context for each matched line.
grep -wnC rename svn_notes

Here is the same search but looking in all files in the current
directory, but without the 2 lines of context before and after.
grep -wn rename ~/bin/learn-cvs/*

This only searches the current directory. To descend into subdirectories
use the -R option and remove the asterisk *.
grep -wnR rename ~/bin/learn-cvs

Same search, but only show the files that were matched, using -l.
grep -wnRl rename ~/bin/learn-cvs

/home/kevin/bin/learn-cvs/cvs_notes
/home/kevin/bin/learn-cvs/www.shellscript.sh/CVS/Entries
/home/kevin/bin/learn-cvs/www.shellscript.sh/common.lib
/home/kevin/bin/learn-cvs/www.shellscript.sh/function2.sh
/home/kevin/bin/learn-cvs/www.shellscript.sh/function3.sh
/home/kevin/bin/learn-cvs/www.shellscript.sh/rename.sh

If we use -c instead of -l:
grep -wnRc rename ~/bin/learn-cvs

Grep returns a list of every file searched, even those containin 0
matches.

Search files in ~/Resume/ for 10 digit phone numbers, or any 12
character word that has - as the 3rd and 6th characters. It finds
phone numbers and '------------'.
grep '...-...-....' ~/Resume/*
