my history

Mom and Dad had an early model IBM PC with yellow text and DOS. Dad
used it for something. Mom used it to track orders and inventory for
dad's parents' Amway business (selling household cleaning supplies).

Dad got a pair of Toshiba laptops in the early 1990s with a bright
backlight and blue text DOS. I typed my first email reply on it to my
aunt living in Brazil at the time. I seem to remember a couple DOS
games. I learned about files, directories, and how to list them in
DOS.

In about 1994, Dad purchased an i486 desktop PC for the kitchen
counter which came with windows 3.1. I got better at DOS commands and
played several games, including Fuzzy's World of Mineature Space Golf.
We used the Juno email app and each had our own address. We used
various encyclopedias on CD including pictures, sound files, and
videos (my favorite). We got onto the Web with Netscape Communicator
web browser.  We watched very early online videos with Reelplayer. I
discovered Google search.

In late 1997, Dad purchased a Dell desktop with Windowss 95. It
included Microsoft Games such as Jewel Chase. The next year, Dad
introduced me to the Battlecruiser game by 3000AD inc. It came with a
thich PDF manual which I printed out and read on early Saturday
mornings before others got up to use the computer.

Dad first introduced me to Red Hat Linux in 1998. I read the printed
manual and O'Reilly's Running Linux 1999 edition. That's where I first
heard of the BSDs. This book taught me basic shell commands and
manpages. Dad maintained a Windows and Linux dual boot setup for many
years. I kept playing the Battlecruiser game and got involved in their
online community and Roleplay story writing based on the game. I also
kept using Linux, though gaming on Windows slowed my Linux learning.

When Red Had Linux split into RHEL and Fedora, dad switched to Debian.
He also introduced me to Perl around that time and I went through the
first part of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.

In January 2004, while still a 17 year old Sophmore in homeschool, I
entered community college, having never owned my own PC or had root
access to Windows or Linux at all. Somewhere around this time, my
sister purchased her first used MacBook.

Dad showed me Mark Shuttleworth's announcement of Ubuntu in 2004 at
DebConf. He switched to it within the next year.

In July 2005, I graduated homeschool with a picture of me in a sharp
blue cap and gown my mom took of me in the park across the street from
our house. Within a month, I got my first taxable job as a clerk at
Walgreens.

At college, I took a few classes specifically about Linux. This and
dad's Unix Power Tools book (O'Reilly) more than doubled my Linux
command knowledge. Meanwhile Dad had settled on KDE as his preferred
DE.

In 2009, I transferred to another Wangreens store in the city and met
a co-worker named Michael. He encouraged me to start playing World of
Warcraft, an MMO which ran only on Windows and macOS, not Linux yet.
saved some money and purchased my first PC at the launch of the games
Cataclysm expansion in 2010. Michael and I custom-built the desktop
from Fry's Electronics. I installed Windows 7 Home Premium.  Michael
also introduced me to CompTIA A+ and we studied it together, and me on
my own later.

In June 2011, I dropped out of college. I was spending too much time
on WoW and not enough time on homework to pass my classes. That
November, I quit my job a Walgreens. I held down a few other retail
jobs and went unemployeed for about a third of the time for the next
two years. 

In late 2011 or 2012, I discoverd Jupiter Broadcasting's Linux Action
Show on Youtube. Michael gave me his old Windows Mobile smartphone and
I used it on wifi only (without cell service). With it I learned about
podcasts and subscribed to Jupiter Broadcasting and discovered the
network's other shows at the time. (From 2003 to 2014, I only had
about 3 basic cell phones, never a smartphone with cell service).

Sometime after finding JB, I purchased a 2010 Asus Eee PC netbook from
my younger brother, removed Windows 7 Starter, and installed Ubuntu.

I caught up on the back catalog of Techsnap and switched from Ubuntu
to Arch after watching Chris and Brian's review of it on the Linux
Action Show. 

On the LAS episode reviewing the release of FreeBSD 9, Alan Jude gave
a great overview of the OS and piqued my interest in the technical
benefits of it over Linux that never occured to me in all the years
since I first heard of Linux and the BSDs. I knew then I wanted to
give it a try when I got a spare PC.

In April 2013, I started volunteering at Free Geek and put my Linux
and A+ knowledge to use for other people. That September, I found and
got my first full-time job of of Craigslist at a Xerox call center for
the Sprint cell phone carrier, which involved mostly billing disputes,
sales commissions, and some tech support. 

In 2014, I purchased my first full-size (used) laptop. It was a 15
inch Acer from Free Geek. I remember having Ubuntu on the Acer, and
Arch on the Asus netbook until I got comfortable enough with Arch to
switch entirely away from Ubuntu to it. That did not happen until 2015
when I got my brother's 15 inch laptop and I installed Antergos on it
(based on Arch). I also moved out of my parents' house and took his
place in his apartment.

I had first heard of Linux User Groups in the Running Linux book.  The
JB hosts had touted the benefits of a LUG for a long time. In 2014, I
searched and found calagator.org, where I found the Portland Linux
Unix Group, and BSD Pizza Night. I attended occasionally and dropped
out in 2015.

Ever since I had purchased my desktop, I had dual-booted Windows 7
with Linux and even removed Windows for brief periods. I remember
booting up the Gentoo installer ISO at some point, but never installed
it. Within two months of moving into the apartment, I quit playing WoW
and gave the desktop to Michael.

My brother's laptop died that summer in 2015 and Dad paid $1100 for me
to order a brand new Lemur model 14 inch laptop from System 76. It
came with Ubuntu and I re-installed it with Antergos. When my wife
Crista's MacBook died in 2016, I let her use the System 76. When she
had trouble with Antergos, I switched it to Fedora while I used
Antergos on the Acer.

During this time, I had been learning more about all the BSDs from
Alan on Techsnap and then even more with the launch of JB's BSD Now. 

In 2017, after we had used Comcast service with their public
xfinitywifi option using neighbor's rouers, I got a modem, router, and
unifi wifi access point. I setup the router with pfSense.

Sometime in 2018, I started attending PLUG and BSD Pizza Night more
again and gradually became a regular there.

In April 2018 I spun up a VPS on Vultr with OpenBSD 6.3. That
November, I switched full time from Antergos to OpenBSD-current on the
Acer. I found out the Acer's touchpad, wifi, and Ethernet seemed to be
having problems with OpenBSD. So in January 2019 I purchased a
Thinkpad t440 on eBay from Blind Center of Nevada and moved my SSD
from Acer to it. I used another SSD in Acer and installed Ubuntu
18.04, though I hardly used it. I had also installed OpenBSD 6.3
release on the netbook and upgraded it to 6.4. 

Shortly after the release of 6.5, I replaced pfSense on the router
with 6.5-current and had to learn quickly how to setup the router
config and PF. I decided then that I needed to learn version control
at some point soon.

In September 2019, I replaced 18.04 on Acer with DragonFly BSD 5.6.2.
However, its touchpad did not work with it and I couldn't get wifi up
with the newer wpa_supplicant from ports, and didn't try the older one
in base.

Waiting to get another Thinkpad to replace Acer before I do more with
DragonFly BSD.

Use CVS for these projects; explore more of CVS as I use it for these
projects.

I should be proficient with CVS at this point. Switch to using SVN for
the next project.


here is where I am today 09-25-19: I am starting to learn subversion.


www.regular-expressions.info

If these tutorials do not work examples through find, grep, awk, and
sed, write up worked examples for them in a new file called
find-grep-awk-sed.

I should be proficient at SVN at this point. Switch to using Git for
the next project or Game of Trees.
