CVS uses keyword substitution. I'm waiting on adding it here until I
learn if Subversion has a different strategy.

https://subversion.apache.org/quick-start
Setting up a local repository 

~/.subversion already existed and has client configuration files. Make
a separate directory for a local repository.

mkdir ~/.svnrepos

### I stopped here. I have renamed cvs paths to not conflict with SVN
paths. Do I want to rename .svnprepos to k9w-svn ? ###

svnadmin create ~/.svnrepos/learn-svn

svn mkdir -m "Create directory structure." \
  file://$HOME/.svnrepos/MyRepo/trunk \
  file://$HOME/.svnrepos/MyRepo/branches \
  file://$HOME/.svnrepos/MyRepo/tags

Create a parent directory .svnrepos where you will place your SVN repositories:
mkdir -p ~/.svnrepos

Create a new repository MyRepo under .svnrepos:
svnadmin create ~/.svnrepos/learn-svn

Create a recommended project layout in the new repository:
svn mkdir -m "Create directory structure." \
	file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/trunk \
	file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/branches \
	file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/tags

Change directory to ~/bin/learn-svn where your unversioned project is
located:

cd $HOME/bin/learn-svn

Convert the current directory into a working copy of the trunk/ in the
repository:
svn checkout file://$HOME/.svnrepos/learn-svn/trunk ./

Schedule your project's files to be added to the repository:
svn add --force ./

Commit the project's files:
svn commit -m "Initial import."

Update your working copy:
svn update

RCS and CVS use per-file version numbers. SVN uses repository-wide
version numbers.

According to svnbook.red-bean.com, CVS store binary files such as pdf
and docx as whole revisions of binary files. SVN can examine binary
files better and can store revisions more space-efficiently on the
server as binary diffs, whereas CVS needs to store an entire copy of
each revision of a binary file in its repository.

Therefore SVN is better for pdf, docx, sound, pictures, videos, compiled
code, and any binary data who's versions should be tracked.

Here I created learn-svn project (like a CVS module) in my k9w-svn
repository. No specials repo files are in the root of k9w-svn.
svnadmin create ~/k9w-svn/learn-svn

Then I descended into learn-svn and created the recommended
subdirectories 'trunk', 'branches', and 'tags'.
cd ~/k9w-svn/learn-svn
svn mkdir -m "Make trunk directory" file:///home/kevin/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk
Committing transaction...
Committed revision 1.
svn mkdir -m "Make branches and tags directories" \
	file://$HOME/k9w-svn/learn-svn/branches \
	file://$HOME/k9w-svn/learn-svn/tags
Committing transaction...
Committed revision 2.

Next, I import files into ~/k9w-svn/learn-svn from ~/bin/learn-cvs. I
don't need to track www.shellscript.sh because I'm done with that
project. Any further work I do on that I can keep doing in CVS. I want
to use SVN for regular expressions, find, grep, awk, and sed, and
perhaps other tools if I need that long to learn SVN. So I hand-picked
some files from learn-cvs and copied them into ~/src/learn-svn as a
temporary location for the import. Here is how I imported those files
into the SVN repository.

I copied selected files from learn-cvs into learn-svn. Then I converted
that directory into a working copy of the repo.
svn checkout file://$HOME/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk ./
Checked out revision 2.

This created the .svn directory in the working copy directory.

Then I added the files and told SVN to track them.
svn add --force ./
A         learning_path
A         my-regex
A         svn_notes
A         find-grep-awk-sed

Lastly, I committed the initial import to the repo.
svn commit -m "Initial import of select files from learn-cvs"
Adding         find-grep-awk-sed
Adding         learning_path
Adding         my-regex
Adding         svn_notes
Transmitting file data ....done
Committing transaction...
Committed revision 3.

To properly track file rename, move, copy, or delete, regular shell
commands won't preserve the change history properly in Subversion.
Instead, use svn move OLD NEW:
svn move find-locate-xargs find-locate

The following command compares the current working copy with the
pristine copy in .svn most recently checked out from the repository.
This is a local compare and does not contact the remote repository.

svn diff svn_notes

To compare two past revisions in the repository,

cvs diff -r 2.2 -r 2.3 find-grep-awk-sed

svn diff -r 3:5 svn_notes

To compare a revision with the one right before it, say revs 4 and 3:
svn diff -c 4 svn_notes

svn annotate -r 3 svn_notes
svn ann svn_notes
svn list -v file:///home/kevin/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk
svn list -vR file:///home/kevin/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk

To revert to an older snapshot of the reponsitory, say revision 7:
svn update -r 7

svn export is like svn checkout. It makes a new working copy but does
not make a .svn directory.

cd [some directory other than the already-existing working copy]
svn export file:///home/kevin/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk trunk

Same, but export an older version (current revision is 11):
svn export file:///home/kevin/k9w-svn/learn-svn/trunk@10 trunk-10
